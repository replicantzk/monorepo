# API

Here is how to get started with our API.

## Setup

- In order to get credits you will currently have to join as a worker until they are available for direct purchase.
  - You can get started as a worker by following this [guide](/docs/quickstart/worker).
- Set up the OpenAI client library of your choice.
  - The `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is `https://platform.replicantzk.com/v1`.
  - The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is generated at [here](https://platform.replicantzk.com/users/settings).
- Use the OpenAI client as usual with the `model` field set to one of the supported models.
    - You can see the list of supported models and associated workers [here](https://platform.replicantzk.com/models).
